= Using Microdetector =

Using microdetector is very simple. Simply place the microdetector package into your project's path, and then add:

{{{microdetector.Middleware}}}

to your `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` tuple in your settings.py

Then in your view you can check `request.mobile` - if it's `True` then treat it like a small screen device. If it's `False` then it's probably a desktop browser, or a spider or something else.
